# Advent of Code 2022
So if you got here I don't know how BUT whatever

This is my repo with my solutions for Advent of Code 2022 in Python

If you don't like, I do NOT care. I know it's not the best solution and it could be done better BUT I'm doing it for myself during night to procrastinate because I should be doing projects for school, work or like thousand of other things and I don't want to think much... Maybe will redo it better someday (well mostly not) BUT hates etc please have for yourself...

So enjoy reading, please do not steal it and have a nice day :grin: :kissing_heart:
